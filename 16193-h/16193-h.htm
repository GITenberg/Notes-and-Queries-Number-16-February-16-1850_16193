<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>DANIEL DE FOE AND HIS GHOST STORIES.</h3>

<p>I feel obliged by your intelligent correspondent
"D.S." having ascertained that De Foe was the
author of the <i>Tour through Great Britain</i>. Perhaps
he may also be enabled to throw some light
on a subject of much curiosity connected with De
Foe, that appears to me well worth the inquiry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bray, in her General Preface prefixed to
the first volume of the reprint, in series, of her
<i>Novels and Romances</i>, when giving an account of
the circumstances on which she founded her very
graphic and interesting romance of <i>Trelawny of
Trelawne</i>, says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In Gilbert's <i>History of Cornwall</i>, I saw a brief but
striking account, written by a Doctor Ruddell, a
clergyman of Launceston, respecting a ghost which (in
the year 1665) he has seen and laid to rest, that in the
first instance had haunted a poor lad, the son of a Mr.
Bligh, in his way to school, in a place called the
'Higher Broom Field.' This grave relation showed,
I thought, the credulity of the times in which the
author of it lived; and so I determined to have doctor,
boy, and ghost in my story. But whereas, in the
worthy divine's account of the transaction, the ghost
appears to come on earth for no purpose whatever
(unless it be to frighten the poor boy), I resolved to
give the spirit something to do in such <i>post-mortem</i>
visitations, and that the object of them should be of
import to the tale. Accordingly I made boy, doctor,
and the woman (who is said after her death to have
appeared to the lad) into characters, invented a story
for them, and gave them adventures."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Bray adds&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Soon after the publication of <i>Trelawny</i>, my much
esteemed friend, the Rev. F.V.T. Arundell<a id="footnotetag01" name="footnotetag01"></a><a href="#footnote01"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, informed
me, that, whilst engaged in his antiquarian researches
in Cornwall, he found among some old and original
papers the manuscript account, in Dr. Ruddell's own
hand-writing, of his encounter with the ghost in question.
This he lent Gilbert, who inserted it in his <i>History
of Cornwall</i>; and there I first saw it, as stated above.
A few months ago, I purchased some of the
reprinted volumes of the <i>Works of Daniel De Foe</i>. Among
these was the <i>Life of Mr. Duncan Campbell</i>, a fortune-teller.
To my great surprise, I found inserted in the
Appendix (after verses to Mr. Duncan Campbell),
without either name of the author, reference, or introduction,
under the heading, 'A remarkable Passage
of an Apparition, 1665,' no other than Dr. Ruddell's
account of meeting the ghost which had haunted the
boy, so much the same as that I had read in Gilbert,
that it scarcely seemed to differ from it in a word.
The name of Mr. Bligh, the father of the boy, was,
however, omitted; and Dr. Ruddell could only be
known as the author of the account by the lad's father
calling the narrator Mr. Ruddell, in their discourse
about the youth. The account is so strangely inserted
in the Appendix to the volume, without comment or
reference, that, had I not previously known the circumstances
above names by Mr. Arundell, I should have
fancied it a fiction of De Foe himself, like the story <span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>{242}</span>
of the ghost of Mrs. Veal, prefixed to <i>Drelincourt on
Death</i>.</p>

<p>"Aware that Mr. Arundell had no idea that Ruddell's
ghost story was to be found in any work previous
to Gilbert's, I lost no time in communicating to that
gentleman what I could not but deem a very curious
discovery. He assured me there could be no mistake
as to the genuineness of the ghost document he had
found, as he had compared the manuscript with Ruddell's
hand-writing in other papers, and saw it was one
and the same. Soon after, Mr. Arundell favoured me
with some further information on the subject, which I
here give, as it adds still more to the interest of the
story:&mdash;'Looking into Gilbert's <i>History of Cornwall</i>,
in the parish of South Petherwin, there is said to be
in the old mansion of Botathan five portraits of the
Bligh family; one of them is the likeness of the boy,
whose intimacy with the ghost of Dorothy Durant has
been spoken of in his first volume, where she is erroneously
called Dingley. If this be a fact, it is very
interesting; for it is strange that both Mr. Ruddell,
the narrator (whose manuscript I lent to Gilbert), and
De Foe, should have called her Dingley. I have no
doubt it was a fictitious name, for I never heard of it
Launceston or the neighbourhood; whereas Durant
is the name of an ancient Cornish family: and I remember
a tall, respectable man of that name in Launceston,
who died at a very advanced age; very probably
a connexion of the Ghost Lady. He must have been
born about 1730. Durant was probably too respectable
a name to be published, and hence the fictitious
one.' Mr. Arundell likewise says, 'In Launceston
Church is a monument to Charles Bligh and Judith
his wife, who died, one in 1716, and the other in 1717.
He is said to have been sixty years old, and was probably
the brother of Samuel, the hero of Dorothy
Dingley. Sarah, the wife of the Rev. John Ruddell,
died in 1667. Mr. Ruddell was Vicar of Aternon in
1684. He was the minister of Launceston in 1665,
when he saw the ghost who haunted the boy.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Such is Mrs. Bray's account of these very
curious circumstances. The ghost story inserted
in Gilbert, as mentioned above, is altogether so
much in the style of De Foe, that a doubt remains
whether, after all, he may not have been the
author of it. Can "D.S.," or any of your readers,
throw further light on the subject?</p>

<h3>PET-NAMES.</h3>

<p>"Mary" is informed that "Polly" is one of those
"hypocorisms," or pet-names, in which our language
abounds. Most are mere abbreviations, as
Will, Nat, Pat, Bell, &amp;c., taken usually from the
beginning, sometimes from the end of the name.
The ending <i>y</i> or <i>ie</i> is often added, as a more
endearing form: as Annie, Willy, Amy, Charlie,
&amp;c. Many have letter-changes, most of which
imitate the pronunciation of infants. <i>L</i> is lisped
for <i>r</i>. A central consonant is doubled. <i>O</i> between
<i>m</i> and <i>l</i> is more easily sounded than <i>a</i>. An
infant forms <i>p</i> with its lips sooner than <i>m</i>; papa
before mamma. The order of change is: Mary,
Maly, Mally, Molly, Polly. Let me illustrate
this; <i>l</i> for <i>r</i> appears in Sally, Dolly, Hal <i>P</i> for
<i>m</i> in Patty, Peggy; vowel-change in Harry, Jim,
Meg, Kitty, &amp;c; and in several of these the
double consonant. To pursue the subject: re-duplication
is used; as in Nannie, Nell, Dandie;
and (by substitution) in Bob. Ded would be of
ill omen; therefore we have, for Edward, Ned or
Ted, <i>n</i> and <i>t</i> being coheir to <i>d</i>; for Rick, Dick,
perhaps on account of the final <i>d</i> in Richard.
Letters are dropped for softness: as Fanny for
Franny, Bab for Barb, Wat for Walt. Maud is
Norman for Mald, from Mathild, as Bauduin for
Baldwin. Argidius becomes Giles, our nursery
friend Gill, who accompanied Jack in his disastrous
expedition "up the hill." Elizabeth gives
birth to Elspeth, Eliza (Eloisa?), Lisa, Lizzie,
Bet, Betty, Betsy, Bessie, Bess; Alexander
(<i>x</i>=<i>cs</i>) to Allick and Sandie. What are we to
say of Jack for John? It seems to be from
Jacques, which is the French for our James?
How came the confusion? I do not remember to
have met with the name James in early English
history; and it seems to have reached us from
Scotland. Perhaps, as Jean and Jaques were
among the commonest French names, John came
into use as a baptismal name, and Jaques or
Jack entered by its side as a familiar term. But
this is a mere guess; and I solicit further information.
John answers to the German Johann or
Jehann, the Sclavonic Ivan, the Italian Giovanni
(all these languages using a strengthening consonant
to begin the second syllable): the French
Jean, the Spanish Juan, James to the German
Jacob, the Italian Giacomo, the French Jacques,
the Spanish Jago. It is observable that of these,
James and Giacomo alone have the <i>m</i>. Is James
derived from Giacomo? How came the name
into Scotland?</p>

<p>Of German pet-names some are formed by
abbreviation; some also add <i>s</i>, as Fritz for Frieds
from Friedrich, Hanns for Hann from Johann.
(To this answers our <i>s</i> or <i>c</i> in the forms Betsy,
Nancy, Elsie, &amp;c.) Some take <i>chen</i> (our <i>kin</i>, as
<i>mannikin</i>) as Franschen, Hannchen. Thus Catskin
in the nursery ballad which appears in Mr.
Halliwell's Collection, is a corruption of K&auml;tchen
Kitty. Most of our softened words are due to
the smooth-tongued Normans. The harsh Saxon
Schrobbesbyrigschire, or Shropshire, was by them
softened into le Comt&eacute; de Salop, and both names
are still used.</p>

<h3>LACED&AElig;MONIAN BLACK BROTH.</h3>

<p>If your readers are not already as much disgusted
with Spartan Black Broth as Dionysius was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>{243}</span>
with the first mouthful, I beg leave to submit a
few supplementary words to the copious indications
of your correspondents "R.O." and "W."</p>

<p>Selden says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"It was an excellent question of Lady Cotton, when
Sir Robert Cotton was magnifying of a shoe, which
was Moses's or Noah's, and wondering at the strange
shape and fashion of it: 'But, Mr. Cotton,' says she,
'<i>are you sure it is a shoe?</i>'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, from the following passage in Manso's
<i>Sparta</i>, it would seem that a similar question
might be put on the present occasion: <i>Are you
sure that it was broth?</i> Speaking of the <i>pheiditia</i>,
Manso says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Each person at table had as much barley-bread as
he could eat; swine's-flesh, or some other meat, to eat
with it, with which the famous black-sauce<a id="footnotetag02" name="footnotetag02"></a><a href="#footnote02"><sup>[2]</sup></a> (whose
composition, without any loss to culinary art, is evidently
a mystery for us) was given round, and to close
the meal, olives, figs, and cheese."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a note he continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Some imagined that the receipt of its composition
was to be found in Plutarch (<i>De Tuend&acirc; Sanitate</i>,
t. vi. p. 487.), but apparently it was only imagination.
That &zeta;&omega;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; signified not broth, as it has been usually
translated, but <i>sauce</i>, is apparent from the connection
in which Athen&aelig;us used the word. To judge from
Hesychius, it appears to have borne the name &beta;&alpha;&phi;&alpha;
among the Spartans. How little it pleased the Sicilian
Dionysius is well known from Plutarch (<i>Inst. Lacon.</i>
t. v. 880.) and from others."</p></blockquote>

<p>Sir Walter Trevelyan's question is soon answered,
for I presume the celebrity of Spartan
Black Broth is chiefly owing to the anecdote of
Dionysius related by Plutarch, in his very popular
and amusing <i>Laconic Apophthegms</i>, which Stob&aelig;us
and Cicero evidently followed; this, and what is to
be gathered from Athen&aelig;us and Julius Pollux,
with a few words in Hesychius and the <i>Etymologicon
Magnum</i>, is the whole amount of our information.
Writers since the revival of letters
have mostly copied each other, from Coelius
Rhodiginus down to Gesner, who derives his conjecture
from Turnebus, whose notion is derived from
Julius Pollux,&mdash;and so we move in a circle. We
sadly want a Greek Apicius, and then we might
resolve the knotty question. I fear we must give
up the notion of cuttle-fish stewed in their own
ink, though some former travellers have not spoken
so favourable of this Greek dish. Apicius, <i>De
Arte Coquinari&acirc;</i>, among his fish-sauces has three
Alexandrian receipts, one of which will give some
notion of the incongruous materials admissible in
the Greek kitchen of later times:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"JUS ALEXANDRINUM IN PISCE ASSO.</p>

<p>"Piper, cepam siccam, ligusticum, cuminum, orignum,
apii semen, pruna damascena enucleata; passum,
liquamen, defrutum, oleum, et coques."</p></blockquote>

<p>This question Vexata it seems had not escaped the
notice of German antiquaries. In Boettiger's <i>Kleine
Shriften</i>, vol. iii., Sillig has printed for the first
time a Dissertation, in answer to a question which
might have graced your pages: "Wherewith did
the Ancients spoon" [their food]? Which opens
thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Though about the composition and preparation of
Spartan Black Sauce we may have only so many
doubts, yet still it remains certain that it was a
<i>jus</i>&mdash;boiled flesh prepared with pig's blood, salt, and vinegar,
a <i>brodo</i>; and, when it was to a certain degree thickened
by boiling, though not like a <i>Polenta</i> or other dough-like
mass (<i>maza offa</i>), eaten with the fingers. Here,
then, arises a gastronomic question, of importance in
arch&aelig;ology; what table furniture or implements did
the Spartans make use of to carry this sauce to their
months? A spoon, or some substitute for a spoon,
must have been at hand in order to be able to enjoy
this Schwarzsauer."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is certain at least that spoons and forks were
unknown to the Spartans, and some have conjectured
that a shell, and even an egg-shell, may
have served the purpose. Those who are desirous
of knowing more about the Table-Supellectile of
the ancients, may consult Casaubon's <i>Notes on
Athen&aelig;us</i>, iv. 13. p. 241.; "Barufaldo de Armis
Convivialibus," in Sallengre's <i>Thesaurus</i>, iii. 741.:
or Boettiger's <i>Dissertation</i> above referred to. How
little ground the passage in Plutarch, <i>De Sanitate
Tuend&acirc;</i>, afforded for the composition will appear
from the passage, which I subjoin, having found
some difficulty in referring to it:</p>

<blockquote><p>&Omicron;&iota; &Lambda;&alpha;&kappa;&omega;&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf; &upsilon;&xi;&omicron;&sigmaf; &kappa;&alpha;&iota; '&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&sigmaf; &delta;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&epsilon;&sigmaf; &tau;&omega; &mu;&alpha;&gamma;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&omega;, &tau;&alpha; &lambda;&omicron;&iota;&pi;&alpha;
&kappa;&epsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&omega; &epsilon;&nu; &tau;&omega; &iota;&epsilon;&rho;&epsilon;&iota;&omega; &zeta;&eta;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;.</p></blockquote>

<p>This only expresses the simplicity of Spartan cookery
in general.</p>

<p>To revert to the original question propounded,
however, I think we must come to the conclusion
that <i>coffee</i> formed no part of the &mu;&epsilon;&lambda;&alpha;&sigmaf; &zeta;&omega;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;.</p>

<h3>A HINT TO INTENDING EDITORS.</h3>

<p>Allow me to suggest, as an addition to the
sphere of usefulness of the "NOTES AND QUERIES,"
that persons preparing new editions of old writers
should give an early intimation of the work on
which they are engaged to the public, through
your paper. Very many miscellaneous readers
are in the habit of making notes in the margins of
their books, without any intention of using them
themselves for publication, and would be glad to
give the benefit of them to any body to whom
they would be welcome; but as matters are now
arranged, one has no opportunity of hearing of an
intended new edition until it is advertised as being
in the press, when it is probably too late to send
notes or suggestions; and one is also deterred
from communicating with the editor from doubts <span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>{244}</span>
whether he will not think it an intrusion: doubts
which any editor who <i>did</i> wish for communications
might dispel by making such an announcement as
I have suggested.</p>

<h3>NOTES UPON CUNNINGHAM'S HAND-BOOK OF LONDON.</h3>

<p><i>St. Giles's Pound</i>.&mdash;The exact site of this
Pound, which occupied a space of thirty feet, was
the broad space where St. Giles's High Street,
Tottenham Court Road, and Oxford Street meet.
The vicinity of this spot was proverbial for its
profligacy; thus in an old song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"At Newgate steps Jack Chance was found,</p>
<p>And bred up near <i>St. Giles's Pound</i>."</p>
</div></div>

<p><i>Dudley Court, St. Giles's</i>.&mdash;This spot was once
the residence of Alice Duchess of Dudley, in the
reign of Charles the Second; and afterwards of
the celebrated Lord Wharton. The mansion and
gardens were of considerable extent.</p>

<p><i>St. Giles's Hospital</i>.&mdash;The celebrated Dr.
Andrew Boorde rented for many years the
Master's house. He is mentioned as its occupant
in the deed of transfer between Lord Lisle to Sir
Wymonde Carewe, dated in the last year of
Henry the Eighth's reign.</p>

<p><i>Gray's Inn Lane</i>.&mdash;Anciently called <i>Portpoole</i>.
See the commission granted to the Master of the
Hospital of St. Giles's, &amp;c. to levy tolls upon all
cattle, merchandize, &amp;c., dated 1346, in Rymer's
<i>Foedera</i>.</p>

<p><i>Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn</i>.&mdash;Lord Herbert
of Cherbury was one of the first inhabitants
of this street, residing at the south side, near the
east corner of Wild (or more properly <i>Weld</i>)
Street, where he died in 1648. The house is still
standing, and is one of fifteen built in the third
year of James the First. <i>Powlet</i> and <i>Conway</i>
houses, also still standing, are among the said
number. The celebrated Dr. Mead (D. 1754)
resided in this street.</p>

<p><i>Turnstile Lane, Holborn</i>.&mdash;Richard Pendrell,
the preserver of Charles the Second, resided here
in 1668. It is supposed that Pendrell, after the
Restoration, followed the king to town, and settled
in the parish of St. Giles, as being near the court.
Certain it is that one of Pendrell's name occurs in
1702 as overseer, which leads to the conclusion
that Richard's descendants continued in the same
locality for many years. A great-granddaughter
of this Richard was living in 1818 in the neighbourhood
of Covent Garden. Richard Pendrell
died in 1674, and had a monument erected to his
memory on the south-east side of the old church
of St. Giles. The raising of the churchyard, subsequently,
had so far buried the monument as to
render it necessary to form a new one to preserve
the memory of this celebrated man. The black
marble slab of the old tomb at present forms the
base of the new one.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cornelly's</i> is stated, in vol. ii. p. 753., <i>to
be</i> "the corner of Sutton Street," Soho Square,
"<i>now D'Almaines's</i>." Mrs. Cornelly's <i>was</i> at the
corner of Sutton Street, but has long been pulled
down: the Catholic chapel <i>in</i> Sutton Street was
Mrs. Cornelly's concert, ball, and masquerade-room;
and the arched entrance below the chapel,
and now a wheelwright's, was the entrance for
"chairs." D'Almaine's is two doors north of
Sutton Street, and was built by Earl (?) Tilney,
the builder of Wanstead House? The House in
Soho Square has a very fine banqueting-room, the
ceiling said to have been painted by Angelica
Kauffmann. Tilney was fond of giving magnificent
dinners, and here was always to be found
"the flesh of beeves, with Turkie and other small
Larks!"</p>

<p><i>Cock Lane</i>.&mdash;The house in Cock Lane famous
for its "Ghost" <i>is still</i> standing, and the back
room, where "scratching Fanny" lay surrounded
by princes and peers, is converted into a gas meter
manufactory.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

<p><i>Easter Eggs</i>.&mdash;The custom of presenting eggs
at Easter is too well known to need description;
but perhaps few are aware that, like many other
customs of the early Church, it had its origin in
paganism.</p>

<p>Sir R.K. Porter (<i>Travels</i>, vol. i. p. 316.)
mentions
that at a period of the year corresponding
to Easter, "the Feast of nooroose, or of the
waters," is held, and seems to have had its origin
prior to Mahometanism. It lasts for <i>six</i> days, and
is supposed to be kept in commemoration of the
Creation and the Deluge&mdash;events constantly
synchronised and confounded in pagan cosmogonies.
At this feast eggs are presented to friends,
in obvious allusion to the Mundane egg, for which
Ormuzd and Ahriman were to contend till the
consummation of all things.</p>

<p>When the many identities which existed between
Druidism and Magianism are considered,
we can hardly doubt that this Persian commemoration
of the Creation originated our Easter-eggs.</p>

<p class="author">G.J.</p>

<p><i>Buns</i>.&mdash;It has been suggested by Bryant,
though, I believe, not noticed by any writer on
popular customs, that the Good Friday cakes,
called <i>Buns</i>, may have originated in the cakes
used in idolatrous worship, and impressed with
the figure of an ox, whence they were called &beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu;.
The cow or bull was likewise, as Coleridge (<i>Lit.
Rem</i>. vol. ii. p. 252.) has justly remarked, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>{245}</span>
symbol of the <i>Cosmos</i>, the prolific or generative
powers of nature.</p>

<p class="author">G.J.</p>

<p><i>Gloucestershire Custom</i>.&mdash;It is a custom in
Gloucestershire, and may be so in other counties,
to place loose <i>straw</i> before the door of any man
who beats his wife. Is this a general custom?&mdash;and
if so, what is its origin and meaning?</p>

<p class="author">B.</p>

<p><i>Curious Custom</i>.&mdash;The custom spoken of by
"PWCCA" (No. 11 p. 173.) was also commonly
practised in one or two places in Lancashire some
ten or twelve years back, but is now, I believe,
obsolete. The horse was played in a similar way,
but the performer was then called "Old Balls."
It is no doubt a vestige of the old "hobby-horse,"&mdash;as
the Norwich "Snap," who kept his place in
the procession of the mayor of that good city till
the days of municipal reform, was the last representative
of his companion the dragon.</p>

<p class="author">J.T.</p>

<p class="note">[Nathan also informs us "that it is very common in
the West Riding of Yorkshire, where a ram's head often
takes the place of the horse's skull. Has it not an obvious
connection with the 'hobby-horse' of the middle
ages, and such mock pageants as the one described in
Scott's <i>Abbot</i>, vol. i. chap. 14.; the whole being a
remnant of the Saturnalia of the ancients?"]</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>

<h3>WHITE HART INN, SCOLE.</h3>

<p>In <i>Songs and other Poems</i>, by Alex. Brome,
Gent. Lond. 12mo. 1661, there is (at p. 123.)
a ballad upon a sign-post set up by one Mr. Pecke,
at Skoale in Norfolk. It appears from this ballad,
that the sign in question had figures of Bacchus,
Diana, Justice, and Prudence, "a fellow that's
small, with a quadrant discerning the wind,"
Temperance, Fortitude, Time, Charon and Cerberus.
This sign is noticed in the <i>Journal</i> of
Mr. E. Browne (Sir Thomas Browne's Works, ed.
Wilkin, i. 53.). Under date of 4th March, 1663-64,
he says:&mdash;"About three mile further I came
to Scoale, where is very handsome inne, and the
noblest sighne post in England, about and upon
which are carved a great many stories, as of
Charon and Cerberus, of Act&aelig;on and Diana, and
many other; the sighne it self is the white harte,
which hangs downe carved in a stately wreath."
Blomefield, in his <i>History of Norfolk</i> (8vo. edit.
i. 130.), speaking of Osmundestone or Scole, has
the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Here are two very good inns for the entertainment
of travellers; the <i>White Hart</i> is much noted in these
parts, being called, by way of distinction, <i>Scole Inn</i>;
the house is a large brick building, adorned with
imagery and carved work in several places, as big as
the life. It was built in 1655, by <i>John Peck</i>, Esq.,
whose arms impaling his wife's, are over the porch
door. The sign is very large, beautified all over with a
great number of images of large stature carved in
wood, and was the work of one <i>Fairchild</i>; the arms
about it are those of the chief towns and gentlemen in
the county, viz. <i>Norwich, Yarmouth, Duke of Norfolk,
Earl of Yarmouth, Bacon of Garboldisham, Hobart,
Conwaleis</i>, impaling <i>Bukton, Teye, Thurston, Castleton</i>,
and many others; <i>Peck's</i> arms are <i>arg</i>. on a
chevron ingrailed, <i>gul</i>. three croslets pattee of the field;
his wife's are <i>arg</i>., a fess between two crescents in
chief, a lion rampant in base <i>gul</i>., which coat I think is
borne by the name of <i>Jetheston</i>. Here was lately a
very round large bed, big enough to hold fifteen or
twenty couple, in imitation (I suppose) of the
remarkable great bed at <i>Ware</i>. The house was in all things
accommodated, at first, for large business; but the
road not supporting it, it is in much decay at present;
though there is a good bowling-green and a pretty
large garden, with land sufficient for passengers' horses.
The business of these two inns is much supported by
the annual cock-matches that are here fought."</p></blockquote>

<p>In Cruttwell's <i>Tour through the whole Island of
Great Britain</i> (Lond. 12mo. 1801), vol. v. 208., is
the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Osmondeston, or Schole. The inn here was once
remarkable for a pompous sign, with ridiculous
ornaments, and is said to have cost a thousand pounds;
long since decayed."</p></blockquote>

<p>I shall be glad to be referred to any other
notices of this sign, and am desirous of knowing if
any drawing or engraving of it be extant.</p>

<h3>PASSAGES FROM POPE.</h3>

<p>In addition to the query of "P.C.S.S." (No.
13. p. 201.), in which I take great interest, I would
beg leave to ask what evidence there is that
Quarles had a <i>pension?</i> He had, indeed, a small
<i>place</i> in the household of James the First's queen,
Anne; and if he had a <i>pension</i> on her death, it
would have been from James, not from Charles.</p>

<p>I would also, in reference to Pope, beg leave to
propound another query.</p>

<p>In the "Imitation of the 2nd Sat. Book I. of
Horace," only to be found in modern editions,
but attributed, I fear, too justly to Pope, there is
an allusion to "poor E&mdash;&mdash;s," who suffered by
"<i>the fatal steel</i>," for an intrigue with a royal
mistress. E&mdash;&mdash;s is no doubt <i>John Ellis</i>, and the
royal mistress the <i>Duchess of Cleveland</i>. (See
Lord Dover's Introduction to the "Ellis Correspondence,"
and "Anecdotes of the Ellis Family,"
<i>Gent. Mag</i>. 1769. p. 328.) But I cannot discover
any trace of the circumstances alluded to by Pope.
Yet Ellis was a considerable man in his day;&mdash;he
had been Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of
Ireland in the reign of Charles II., and was Under-Secretary
of State under William III.; he is said
to have afterwards sunk into the humbler character <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>{246}</span>
of a "London magistrate," and to have "died in
1788, at 93 or 95, immensely rich." I should be
glad of any clue to Pope's allusion.</p>

<p class="i16"><i>Essay on Man</i>, Epistle IV. 203.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Will your correspondent "P.C.S.S." (No. 13),
evidently a critical reader of Pope, and probably
rich in the possession of various editions of his
works, kindly inform me whether any commentator
on the poet has traced the well-known
lines that I have quoted to the "Corcillum est,
quod homines facit, c&aelig;tera quisquilia omnia" of
Petronius Arbiter, cap. 75.? Pope had certainly
both read and admired the <i>Satyricon</i>, for he
says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Fancy and art in gay Petronius please,</p>
<p>The scholar's learning with the courtier's ease."</p>

<p>I find no note on the lines either in the edition of
Warton, 9 vols. 8vo., London, 1797, or in Cary's
royal 8vo., London, 1839; but the similarity
strikes me as curious, and deserving further examination.</p>

<h3>MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

<p><i>MSS. formerly belonging to Dr. Hugh Todd</i>.&mdash;I
shall feel most grateful to any of your correspondents
who can afford me any information, however
imperfect, respecting the MSS. of Dr. Hugh Todd,
Vicar of Penrith, and Prebendary of Carlisle,
in the beginning of the last century. In the <i>Cat.
MSS. Angli&aelig;</i>, &amp;c., 1697, is a catalogue of nineteen
MSS, then in his possession, five of which
are especially the subject of the present inquiry.
One is a Chartulary of the Abbey of Fountains,
in 4to; another is an Act Book of the Consistory
Court of York, in the fifteenth century, in folio;
the third is the Chapter Book of the Collegiate
Church of Ripon, from 1452 to 1506; the fourth
contains Extracts and Manuscripts from Records
relating to the Church of Ripon; and the last is
apparently a Book of the Acts of the Benefactors
to that foundation. In a letter to Humphrey
Lawley, dated in 1713, Dr. Todd says he was engaged
in a work relating to the province of York,
and the greater part of the MSS. in the catalogue
above mentioned appear to have been collected as
the materials.</p>

modern works on Portugal, giving an account

stanza:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Curious Monumental Brass</i>.&mdash;I have a rubbing
of a Brass, presenting some peculiarities which
have hitherto puzzled me, but which probably
some of your more experienced correspondents
can clear up.</p>

<p>The Brass, from which the rubbing is taken
(and which was formerly in the Abbey church of
St. Albans, but when I saw it was detached and
lying at the Rectory), is broken off a little below
the waist; it represents an abbot, or bishop, clad
in an ornamented chasuble, tunic, stole, and alb,
with a maniple and pastoral staff. So far all is
plain; but at the back (i.e. on the surface hidden
when the Brass lay upon the floor) is engraved
a dog with a collar and bells, apparently as carefully
executed as any other part. Can you tell
me the meaning of this? I can find no mention
of the subject either in Boutell or any other
authority. The fragment is about 18 inches long,
and the dog about 6, more or less.</p>

<p><i>Bishop Blaize</i>.&mdash;I should be much obliged by
any reference to information respecting Bishop
Blaize, the Santo Biagio of Agrigentum, and
patron saint of Ragusa. Butler says little but
that he was bishop of Sebaste, in Armenia, the
proximity of which place to Colchis appears to me
suspicious. Wonderful and horrible tales are told
of him; but I suspect his patronage of wool-combers
is founded on much more ancient legends.
His establishment at Agrigentum must have been
previous to Christianity. I have a vague remembrance
of some mention of him in Higgins's
<i>Anacalypsis</i>, but I have not now access to that
work. I wish some learned person would do for

there were dispersed in St. Ives a great number
of swords, bearing the initials of the Protector
upon them; and, further, that a large barn, which
Oliver built there, was still standing, and went by
the name of Cromwell's Barn; and that the farmer
then renting the farm occupied by the Protector
circa 1630-36, marked his sheep with the identical

<p>And if she won't, she won't, and there's an end on't."</p>
</div></div>

<p>I have heard these lines confidently attributed to
Shakspeare, Byron, &amp;c. by persons unable to
verify the quotation, when challenged so to do.
I can point out where the first two lines may be
found with some variation. In <i>The Adventures
of Five Hours</i>, a comedy translated from the
Spanish of Calderon, by Samuel Tuke, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>{248}</span>
printed in the 12th volume of Dodsley's <i>Old Plays</i>
(edit. 1827), in the 5th act (p. 113.), the lines run
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"He is a fool, who thinks by force or skill</p>
<p>To turn the current of a woman's will."</p>
</div></div>

applies to fish-<i>swimming</i> and not to fish-<i>catching</i>;
and I presume that "useful and sagacious" auxiliary,
Dr. Kitchener himself, would hardly have
ventured to deny that <i>fish</i> may <i>swim quickly</i>?</p>

<p>Now let us try how MR. THORPE'S proposed
<i>salice=wicker</i>, or <i>sallow</i>, with or without the
<i>basket</i>, will suit the context. The fisherman is
asked, "Quales pisces capias? = What fish do
you take?" The answer is Anguillos &amp;c. &amp;c.
et qualescunque in amne natant salu = Eels
&amp;c. &amp;c., and every sort whatever that in water
swimmeth
[wicker/sallow] basket! Let it be remembered
that the question here is not, "<i>How</i> dost thou
take fish?" which had been put and <i>answered
before</i>, but "<i>What</i> fish dost thou take?" and then
let common sense decide; for the fisherman having
already mentioned that he cast <i>nets</i> and <i>hooks</i>, and
[<i>spyrian</i>/spartas], i.e. <i>baskets</i>, now only replies as to the
<i>fish</i> he takes.</p>

<p>MR. THORPE calls the A.-S. dialogue a <i>Gloss</i>;
is it not rather an <i>interlineary version</i>? like those
in use, in later times, of Corderius, and used for
the same purpose.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that upon more mature consideration
MR. THORPE will see that it could not
be a substantive that was intended; and, as he
admits my conjecture to be <i>specious</i>, that he will,
in the course of his very useful labours, ultimately
find it not only specious but correct. Meanwhile,
I submit to his consideration, that beside the
analogy of the Gothic <i>sprauto</i>, we have in Icelandic
<i>spretta</i>, imperf. <i>spratt</i>, "subito movere,
repente salire, emicare;" and <i>sprettr</i>, "cursus
citatus," and I do think these analogies warrant
my conclusion.</p>

<p>I embrace this opportunity of submitting another
<i>conjecture</i> respecting a word in MR. THORPE'S
edition of the <i>Anglo-Saxon Paraphrase of the
Psalms</i>. It occurs in Ps. cvi. ver. 10., "Quid
exacerbaverunt eloquium Domini," &amp;c., which is
rendered: "Forthon hidydan Drihtnes spr&aelig;ce
&aelig;gwaes <i>&aelig;gype</i>." In a note MR. THORPE says:
"<i>&aelig;gype</i>, non intelligo," and gives a reason for
deeming the passage corrupt. To me it seems to
express the generally accepted sense of <i>exacerbaverunt</i>:
and here a cognate language will show
us the way. Icelandic <i>geip</i>, futilis exaggeratio;
<i>atgeipa</i>, exaggerare, effutire: <i>&aelig;gype</i>, then, means
to <i>mock</i>, to <i>deride</i>, and is allied to <i>gabban</i>, to gibe,
to jape. In the Psalter published by Spelman it
is rendered: hi <i>gremedon</i> spr&aelig;ce godes. In Notker
it is <i>widersprachen</i>, and in the two old Teutonic
interlinear version of the Psalms, published
by Graff, <i>verbitterten</i> and <i>gebittert</i>. Let us hear
our own interesting old satirist, Piers Plouhman
[Whitaker's ed. p. 365.]:</p>

<blockquote><p>And God wol nat be gyled, quoth Gobelyn, ne be
<i>japed</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>But I cease, lest your readers should exclaim,
Res non verba. When I have more leisure for
<i>word-catching</i>, should you have space, I may
furnish a few more.</p>

<p><i>&AElig;lfric's Colloquy</i>.&mdash;I have my doubts whether
MR. SINGER'S ingenious suggestions for explaining
the mysterious word <i>sprote</i> can be sustained. The
Latin sentence appears clearly to end with the
word <i>natant</i>, as is not only the case in the St.
John's MS., mentioned in MR. THORPE'S note,
but in fact, also in the Cottonian MS. There is
a point after <i>natant</i>, and then follows the word
<i>Saliu</i> (not <i>salu</i>) with a capital <i>S</i>. Any person
who examines the handwriting of this MS. will
see that the word, whatever the transcriber may
have understood by it, was intended by him to
stand alone. He must, however, have written it
without knowing what it meant; and then comes
the difficulty of explaining how it got into the
MS. from which he copied. It has always appeared
to me probable that the name of some
fish, having been first interlined, was afterwards
inserted at random in the text, and mis-spelt by
a transcriber who did not know its meaning.
A word of common occurrence he would have
been less likely to mistake. Can <i>saliu</i> be a mistake
for <i>salar</i>, and <i>sprote</i> the Anglo-Saxon form of
the corresponding modern word <i>sprod</i>, i.e. the
salmon of the second year? The <i>salar</i> is mentioned
by Ausonius in describing the river Moselle
and its products (<i>Idyll</i>. 10, l. 128.).</p>

<h3>ANTONY ALSOP.</h3>

<p>"R.H." (No. 14, p. 215.) will find all, I believe,
that is known respecting Antony Alsop, in that
rich storehouse of materials for the literary history
of the last century, Nichols's <i>Anecdotes</i>, or in
Chalmers (<i>Biog. Dict.</i>), who has merely transcribed
from it. The volume of <i>Latin Odes</i> your
correspondent mentions, was published by Sir
Francis Bernard, and printed by Bowyer. Some
notice of Sir Francis Bernard will also be found
in Nichols.</p>

<p>The <i>Odes</i> were long circulated in MS.; and I
have a copy that once belonged to Thomas Warton,
which seems to have been written by G. Crochly,
of Christchurch College, in 1736. It contains,
however, nothing that is not to be found in the
printed volume. The Dedication to the Duke of
Newcastle was written by Bernard, who had intended
to have given a preface and copious notes,
as appears by the prospectus he published: but,
to our great regret, he was dissuaded from his
purpose.</p>

<p>Alsop was a favourite with that worthy man
and elegant scholar Dean Aldrich, at whose instance
he published his pleasing little volume,
<i>Fabularum &AElig;sopicarum Delectus</i>, Oxon. 1698. In
the preface Bentley is thus designated&mdash;"Richardum
quendam Bentleium Virum in volvendis
Lexicus satis diligentem:" and there is a severe
attack upon him in one of the fables, which was
not forgotten by the great scholar, who affects
to speak of Tony Alsop the fabulist with great
contempt.</p>

<p>I have never seen the volume of <i>Latin and
English Poems</i> published in 1738; but, notwithstanding
the designation, "a gentleman of Trinity
College," it may be at least partly by Alsop,
though he undoubtedly was of Christchurch.
There are English poems by him, published both
in Dodsley's and Pearch's collection, and several
in the early volumes of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>.
I have the authority of a competent judge for
saying, that the very witty, but not quite decent
verses in that miscellany, vol. v. p. 216&mdash;"Ad
Hypodidasculum quendam plagosum, alterum orbilium,
ut uxorem duceret, Epistola hortativa."
Subscribed "Kent, Lady-day, 1835"&mdash;are Alsop's.
He took the degree of M.A. in 1696, and
of B.D. in 1706, and, by favour of the Bishop of
Winchester, got a prebend in his cathedral, and
the rectory of Brightwell, Berks. He was accidentally
drowned in a ditch leading to his garden
gate, in 1726. There is good reason to believe
that a MS. life of him is to be found among the
Rawlinson MSS., which it may be worth while to
consult.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Christchurch was
the head-quarters of the phalanx of wits opposed to
Bentley.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Nor wert thou, Isis, wanting to the day,</p>
<p>[Tho' Christchurch long kept prudishly away,"]</p>
</div></div>

<p>is Pope's ironical banter; and he has not failed to
mention Alsop and Freind in Bentley's speech:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Let Freind affect to speak as Terence spoke,</p>
<p>And Alsop never but like Horace joke,"</p>
</div></div>

<p>where the note says, "Dr. Antony Alsop, a happy
imitator of the Horatian style."</p>

<p>Indeed, Alsop seems to have been duly esteemed
and appreciated by his contemporaries; and every
tasteful scholar will concur in the opinion that his
truly elegant Sapphics deserve a place among the
few volumes of modern Latin verse, which he
would place near Cowper's more extensively known
favourite, Vinny Bourne.</p>

<p class="author">S.W.S.</p>

<p>Antony Alsop, respecting whom a query appears
in No. 14. p. 215., was of Christchurch, under the
famous Dr. Aldrich, by whom the practice of
smoking was so much enjoyed and encouraged.
The celebrated Sapphic ode, addressed by Alsop
to Sir John Dolben, professes to have been written
with a pipe in his mouth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Dum tubum, ut mos est meus, ore versans,</p>
<p>Martiis pensans quid agam calendas,</p>
<p>Pone stat Sappho monitisque miscet</p>
<p class="i6">Blanda severis."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Ant. Alsop took his degree of M.A. March 23.
1696, B.D. Dec. 1706. He died June 10, 1726;
and the following notice of his death appears in
the <i>Historical Register</i> for that year:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dy'd Mr. Antony Alsop, Prebendary of Winchester,
and Rector of Brightwell, in the county of
Berks. He was killed by falling into a ditch that led
to his garden door, the path being narrow, and part of
it foundering under his feet."</p>

<p>I believe Alsop was not the author of a volume
by a gentleman of Trinity College, and that he
never was a member of that society; but that
doubt is easily removed by reference to the entry
of his matriculation at Oxford.</p>

<p class="author">W.H.C.</p>

<p>Temple.</p>

<p>"R.H." inquires, whether Antony Alsop was
at Trinity College before he became a student of
Christchurch? I have considered it to be my
duty to examine the Admission Registers of
Trinity College in my possession since the foundation
of the college; and I can only say, that I
do not find the name in any of them. That he
was at Christchurch, and admitted there as a student,
is recorded by his biographers. It is also <span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>{250}</span>
said, that he was elected at once from Westminster
to Christchurch, where he took the degree of M.A.
March 23. 1696, and that of B.D. Dec. 12. 1706.
He was soon distinguished by Dean Aldrich as
worthy of his patronage and encouragement. He
was consequently appointed tutor and censor, and
in course of time left college, on his promotion to
a prebendal stall in Winchesser Cathedral by Sir
Jonathan Trelawney, the then Bishop, with the
rectory of Brightwell, near Wallingford; at which
latter place he chiefly resided till the time of his
death, which happened by an accident, June 10.
1726. Sir Francis Bernard, Bart., who had himself
been a student of Christchurch, published the
4to. volume of <i>Latin Odes</i> mentioned by "R.H.,"
Lond. 1753; for which he had issued <i>Proposals</i>,
&amp;c., so early as July, 1748. In addition to these
<i>Odes</i>, four English poems by Alsop are said to be
in Dodsley's collection, one in Pearch's, several in
the early volumes of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>,
and some in <i>The Student</i>. Dr. Bentley calls him,
rather familiarly, "Tony Alsop, editor of the
<i>&AElig;sopian Fables</i>;" a work published by him at
Oxford, in 1698, 8 vo., in the preface to which he
took part against Dr. Bentley, in the dispute with
Mr. Boyle.</p>

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>


<p><i>Origin of the Word "Snob"</i>.&mdash;I think that
<i>Snob</i> is not an archaism, and that it cannot be
found in any book printed fifty years ago. I am
aware that in the north of England shoe-makers
are still sometimes called <i>Snobs</i>; but the word is
not in Brockett's <i>Glossary of North Country Words</i>,
which is against its being a genuine bit of northern
dialect.</p>

<p>I fancy that <i>Snobs</i> and <i>Nobs</i>, as used in vulgar
parlance, are of classic derivation; and, most probably,
originated at one of the Universities, where
they still flourish. If a <i>Nob</i> be one who is <i>nobilis</i>,
a <i>Snob</i> must be one who is <i>s[ine] nob[ilitate]</i>.
Not that I mean to say that the <i>s</i> is literally a
contraction of <i>sine</i>; but that, as in the word slang,
the <i>s</i>, which is there prefixed to <i>language</i>, at once
destroys the better word, and degrades its meaning;
and as, in Italian, an <i>s</i> prefixed to a primitive
word has a privative effect&mdash;e.g. <i>calzare</i>,
"to put on shoes and stockings;" <i>scalzare</i>, "to
put them off:" <i>fornito</i>, "furnished;" <i>sfornito</i>,
"unfurnished," &amp;c.; as also the <i>dis</i>, in Latin (from
which, possibly, the aforesaid <i>s</i> is derived), has the
like reversing power, as shown in <i>continue</i> and
<i>discontinue</i>&mdash;so <i>nob</i>, which is an abbreviation of
<i>nobilis</i>, at once receives the most ignoble signification
on having an <i>s</i> put before it.</p>

<p>The word <i>Scamp</i>, meaning literally a fugitive
from the field, one <i>qui ex campo exit</i>, affords another
example of the power of the initial <i>s</i> to reverse
the signification of a word.</p>

<p>All this, Mr. Editor, is only conjecture, in reply
to "ALPHA's" query (No. 12 p. 185.); but perhaps
you will receive it, if no better etymology of
the word be offered.</p>

<p class="author">A.G.</p>

<p>Ecclesfield, Jan. 21. 1850.</p>

<p><i>Derivation(?) of "Snob" and "Cad."</i>&mdash;I am
informed by my son, who goeth to a Latin school,
that <i>Snob</i> (which is a word he often useth) cometh
of two Latin words; to wit, "<i>sine obolo</i>"&mdash;as
who should say, "one that hath not a cross to
bless himself." He saith, that the man behind the
omnibus is called "<i>Cad</i>," "<i>a non cadendo</i>." Your

<p><i>Sir Stephen Fox.</i>&mdash;I have seen it stated in
some biographical dictionary, that Sir Stephen
Fox was a younger brother of "John Fox, Esq.,"
who was a devoted Royalist at the time of the
great Rebellion, and fought at the battle of Worcester, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>{251}</span>
and after the Restoration was Clerk of the
Acatry, in the household of Charles the Second.</p>

<p>Mr. Suckling, in his <i>History of Suffolk</i>, claims
for a family some time seated at Stradbrook, in
that county, a consanguinity with the descendants
of Sir Stephen.</p>

<p>On an altar-tomb in Stadbrook churchyard
are inscribed notices of many members of this
family, but without dates. One is rather extraordinary,
making the lives of a father and son
together to amount to 194 years. Amongst them
is this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Here is hourly expected, Simon the next descendant,
with his son Simon, who died young, tho' still
preserved to be interr'd with his father at the earnest
request of his pious mother the Lady Hart. And also
Major John Fox, with his issue, who during the late
rebellion loyally behav'd himself, undergoing with
great courage not only the danger of the field, but
many severe imprisonments."</p></blockquote>

<p>The arms on this tomb differ from those of
Lords Ilchester and Holland, being simply three
foxes' heads erased.</p>

<p>Should this note supply a clue for your correspondent
"VULPES" to identify Major John Fox
with the brother of Sir Stephen, on knowing that
he has found the scent I shall be able to assist
him in unearthing the whole litter.</p>

<p class="author">VENATOR.</p>

<p><i>French Maxim</i>.&mdash;The maxim inquired after
by "R.V." (No. 14. p. 215.) undoubtedly belongs
to Rochefoucault. I have met with a somewhat
similar passage in Massillon:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Le vice rend hommage &agrave; la vertu en s'honorant de
sus apparences."</p></blockquote>

<p class="author">J.B.M.</p>

<p>Feb. 5. 1850.</p>

<p><i>Shipster</i>.&mdash;A <i>scip-steora</i> among our Anglo-Saxon
ancestors was a pilot ("<i>ship-steerer</i>"). The
word has descended to our own times in the surname
of the family Shipster. As a common
noun it was not obsolete in the days of Wynkyn
de Worde, who printed that curious production
"<i>Cock Lorelle's Bote</i>," one line of which runs
thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"With gogle-eyed Tomson, <i>shepster</i> of Lyn."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is pretty certain, however, that this masculine
occupation was not the one followed by "Marie
Fraunceys de Suthwerk!"</p>

<p>Pray accept this "Reply" for what it is worth.
Perhaps I might have done better by meeting
Mr. John R. Fox's "Query" (No. 14. p. 216.)
with another. Should not the designation of
Marie F. be <i>Spinster</i> instead of Shipster?</p>

<p class="author">MARK ANTONY LOWER.</p>

<p>Lewes, Feb. 2.</p>

<p><i>Sparse</i>.&mdash;Permit me to refer your correspondent
"C. FORBES" for a reply to his query,
p. 215. of your last Number, to the article "Americanism"
in the <i>Penny Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, the author of
which observes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Sparse</i> is, for any thing we know, a new word, and
well applied; the Americans say a <i>sparse</i> instead of a
scattered population; and we think the term has a
more precise meaning than scattered, and is the proper
correlative of <i>dense</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the <i>Imperial Dictionary</i> (avowedly based
upon Webster's American work, which I cannot
at this moment refer to in its original form), the
word in question is given both as an adjective and
as a verb, and the derivatives "sparsed," "sparsedly,"
"sparsely," and "sparseness," are also
admitted. The reference given for the origin of
"sparse" is to the Latin "<i>sparsus</i>, scattered, from
<i>spargo</i>;" and the definitions are, 1. "Thinly scattered,
set or planted here and there; as, a <i>sparse</i>
population:" and, 2., as a botanical term, "not
opposite, not alternate, nor in any regular order;
applied to branches, leaves, peduncles, &amp;c."</p>

in considerable haste, I must send replies to the

<p><i>Cosmopolis</i> was certainly Amsterdam. That
the <i>Interpretationes paradox&aelig; quatuor Evangeliorum</i>,
by Christophorus Christophori Sandius,
were there printed, appears from this writer's
<i>Bibliotheca Anti-Trinitarionum</i>, p. 169., Freistad,
1684. I may add that "Coloni&aelig;" signifies "Amstel&aelig;dami"
in the title-page of Sandius's <i>Nucleus
Histori&aelig; Ecclesiastic&aelig;</i>, 1676, and in the <i>Appendix
Addendorum</i>, 1678, 4to.</p>

<p>With regard to the MSS. used in the formation
of the text of the <i>Complutensian Polyglot</i>, Mr. Jebb
will find an account of their discovery in a letter
addressed by Dr. James Thompson to the editor of
<i>The Biblical Review</i>. See also <i>The Irish Ecclesiastical
Journal</i> for April 1847.</p>

<p class="author">R.G.</p>

<p><i>Complutensian Polyglot</i>.&mdash;The following extract
from "The Prospectus of a Critical Edition of the
New Testament," by the learned Mr. S. Prideaux
Tregelles, affords a satisfactory reply to Mr.
Jebb's query, No. 14. p. 212.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"However there is now more certainty as to the
MSS. belonging to the University of Alcala. Dr.
James Thompson has published (<i>Biblical Review</i>,
March, 1847), the result of inquiries made thirty years
ago by Dr. Bowring, and more recently by himself.
Hence it appears that all the MSS. which formerly
were known as belonging to Cardinal Ximenes, and
which were preserved in the library of Alcala, are now
with the rest of that library, at Madrid....Dr. Jos&eacute;
Gutierrez, the present librarian at Madrid, communicated
to Dr. J. Thomson a catalogue of the Complutensian
MSS., and from this it appears that the
principal MSS. used in the Polyglott are all safely
preserved."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>"Peruse."</i>&mdash;In reply to the question of "H.W."
(No. 14. p. 215.), although from want of minute
reference I have been unable to find, in the original
edition, the quotation from Frith's works,
I beg leave to suggest that the word "Peruse" is
a misprint, and that the true reading is "Pervise."
To this day the first examination at Oxford, commonly
called the "Little-Go," is "Responsiones
in <i>Parviso</i>." It must not, however, be supposed
that "Pervise," or "Parvise," is derived from the
Latin "Parvus;" the origin, according to Spelman
and succeeding etymologists, is the French "Le
Parvis," a church porch.</p>

<p>In London the Parvis was frequented by serjeants
at law: see Chaucer, <i>Prol. Cant. Tales</i>.
There is a difference of opinion where it was
situated: see Tyrwhitt's <i>Gloss</i>. The student in
ecclesiastical history may compare <i>Leo Allatius de
Templis Gr&aelig;corum</i>, p. 44.</p>

<p><i>Autograph Mottoes of Richard Duke of Gloucester
and Harry Duke of Buckingham</i>. (No. 9.
p. 138.)&mdash;There can be no doubt that "Mr. NICOLS"
is somewhat wrong in his interpretation of
the Duke of Buckingham's Motto. It is evident
that both mottoes are to be read continuously,
and that "souene" is the third person singular of a
verb having "loyaulte" for its nominative case. It
appears to me that the true reading of the word
is "soutienne," and that the meaning of the motto
is "My feelings of loyalty often sustain me in my
duty to the King when I am tempted to join those
who bear no good feeling towards him." So that
we shall have in English,</p>

<p><i>Boduc.</i>&mdash;Your correspondent "P." (No. 12,
p. 185.) seems to consider the "prevailing opinion,"
that <i>Boduc</i> or <i>Boduoc</i> on the British coin
must be intended for our magnanimous Queen
Boadicea, to be merely a "pleasing vision," over
which he is "<i>sorry</i> to cast a cloud." Yet his own
remark, that the name Budic (a mere difference
in spelling) is often found among families of the
Welsh in Brittany, and that the name was once
common in England, serves only to confirm the
common opinion that <i>Boduoc</i> on the coins was
intended as the name of the British Queen.</p>

<p>Dio expressly writes her name in Greek Boudouica,
which approaches nearly to Budic. In
Cornwall we still find Budock, the name of a
parish and of a saint. In Oxford there was a
church formerly called from St. Budoc, long
since destroyed. Leland mentions a Mr. Budok,
and his manor place, and S. Budok Church. His
opinion was, that "this Budocus was an Irisch
man, and cam into Cornewalle, and ther dwellid."
Whether there was a Regulus of Britain of this
name, is not material. I am not prepared to
cast a cloud over it, if it should be found. Our
motto should be, "ex fumo dare lucem," &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Annus Trabeationis</i>.&mdash;I am sure that you will
allow me to correct an oversight in your reply to
a query of "G.P.," in No. 7. p. 105. You have
attributed to Du Cange a sentence in the Benedictine
addition to his explanation of the term
<i>Trabeatio</i>. (<i>Glossar</i>. tom. vi. col. 1158. Venet.
1740.) This word certainly signifies the Incarnation
of Christ, an not his Crucifixion. Besides
the occurrence of "trabea carnis indutus," at the
commencement of a sermon on S. Stephen by S.
Fulgentius Ruspensis, I have just now met with
the expressions, "trabea carnis velatus," and
"carnis trabea amicti," in a copy of the <i>editio
princeps</i> of the Latin version of Damascen's books
in defence of Image-worship, by Godefridus Tilmannus,
fol. 30 b. 39 a, 4to. Paris, 1555.</p>

<p><i>Doctor Dobbs and his Horse Nobbs</i>.&mdash;I remember
having read somewhere of "Doctor Dobbs
and his horse Nobbs," but where I cannot now
recall. I only remember one anecdote. The horse
Nobbs was left, one cold night, outside a cottage,
whilst the Doctor was within officiating as accoucheur
(I believe); when he was ready to start,
and came out, he found the horse apparently dead.
The Doctor was miles from home, and, as the
horse was dead, and the night dark, in place of
walking home, he, with his host, dragged the
horse into the kitchen, and skinned him, by way
of passing the time profitably. But, lo! when
the skinning was finished, the horse gave signs of
returning animation. What was to be done?
Doctor Dobbs, fertile in resources, got sheepskins
and sewed them on Nobbs, and completely
clothed him therein; and&mdash;mirabile dictu!&mdash;the
skins became attached to the flesh, Nobbs recovered,
and from thenceforward carried a <i>woolly</i> coat,
duly shorn every summer, to the profit of
Doctor Dobbs, and to the wonder and admiration
of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I have also read somewhere that Coleridge told
the story of "Doctor Dobbs and his horse Nobbs"
to Southey at Oxford.</p>

<p class="author">J.M.B.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Dobbs and his Horse Nobbs</i>.&mdash;Although of
small moment, it is, perhaps, worth recording,
that a Doctor Daniel Dove, of Doncaster, and his
horse Nobbs, form the subjects of a paper in "The
Nonpareil, or the Quintessence of Wit and
Humour," published in 1757, and which, there
can be little doubt, was the source whence
Southey adopted, <i>without alteration</i>, the names so
well known to all readers of the <i>Doctor</i>.</p>

<p><i>St. Evona's Choice.</i>&mdash;To your citation of Ben
Jonson's exceptional case of the Justice Randall
as "a lawyer an honest man," in justice add the
name of the learned and elegant author of
<i>Eunomus</i>; for Mr. Wynne himself tells the story
of St. Evona's choice (Dialogue II. p. 62. 3rd ed.
Dublin, 1791), giving his authority in the following
note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The story here dressed up is told in substance in a
small book published in 1691, called a <i>Description of
the Netherlands</i>," p. 58.</p></blockquote>

<p>In strict law, Sir, the profession may in courts
of Momus be held bound by the act of the respectable
but unlucky St. Evona; but in equity,
let me respectfully claim release, for Evona was a
<i>churchman</i>.</p>

<p class="author">A TEMPLAR.</p>

<p class="note">[We gladly insert our correspondent's "claim to release,"
but doubt whether he can establish it; inasmuch
as St. Ivo or Evona, canonized on account of his great
rectitude and profound knowledge both of civil and
canon law, was both lawyer and churchman, like the
CLERICUS so recently discussed in our columns; and
clearly sought for and obtained his patron saint in his
legal character.]</p>

<p><i>Muffins and Crumpets, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Not being quite
satisfied with the etymology of "muffin," in p.
205., though brought by Urquhart from Phoenicia
and the Pillars of Hercules, I am desirous of
seeking additional illustration. Some fancy that
"coffee" was known to Athen&aelig;us, and that he
saw it <i>clearly</i> in the "black broth" of the Laced&aelig;monian
youth. In the same agreeable manner
we are referred to that instructive and entertaining
writer for the corresponding luxury of
"muffins." <i>Maphula</i>, we are told, was one of
those kinds of bread named as such by Athen&aelig;us;
that is to say, "a cake baked on a hearth or
griddle." If we need go so far, why not fetch our
muffins from Memphis, which is <i>M&ocirc;ph</i> in Hebrew?
(See <i>Hosea</i>, ix. 6.) It is, perhaps, <i>mou-pain</i>, in
old French, <i>soft bread</i>, easily converted into
<i>mouffin</i>. So "crumpet" may be a corruption of
<i>crump&acirc;te</i> a paste made of fine flour, slightly
baked. The only difficulty would then be in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>{254}</span>
first syllable, concerning, which the ingenuity of
your various correspondents, Mr. Editor, may be
exercised to some effect. Is it connected with
the use of the <i>crimping</i> irons in producing these
delicacies?</p>

<p><i>Dulcarnon</i>.&mdash;Dulcarnon is one of those words
in Chaucer which Tyrwhitt professes that he does
not understand. It occurs in <i>Trolius and Creseide</i>,
book iii. 931.933. Creseide says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"I am, til God me better minde sende,</p>
<p>At <i>Dulcarnon</i>, right at my witt'is ende.</p>
<p class="i2">Quod Pandarus ye nece, wol ye here,</p>
<p><i>Dulcarnon</i> clepid is fleming<a id="footnotetag03" name="footnotetag03"></a><a href="#footnote03"><sup>[3]</sup></a> of wretches."</p>
</div></div>

<p>This passage of <i>Trolius and Creseide</i> is quoted
in the life of Sir Thomas More, given in Wordsworth's
<i>Ecclesiastical Biography</i>. More's daughter
said to him, when he was in prison, "Father, I
can no further goe; I am come, as Chaucer said of
Cressid Dulcarnon, to my witt's end."</p>

<p>Has this passage been satisfactorily explained
since Tyrwhitt's time? The epithet "Dulcarnon"
is mentioned in a note to the translation of
Richard de Bury's <i>Philobiblon</i>, London, 1832. I
give the note in full. It is in reference to the
word "Ellefuga":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"This word was a pons asinorum to some good
Grecians,&mdash;but that is probably its meaning<a id="footnotetag04" name="footnotetag04"></a><a href="#footnote04"><sup>[4]</sup></a>; at
least making it the name of a problem gets over all
difficulty. The allusion is to the flight of Helle, who
turned giddy in taking a flying leap, mounted on a
ram, and fell into the sea;&mdash;so weak a head fails in
crossing the pons. The problem was invented by
Pythagoras, 'and it hath been called by barbarous
writers of the latter time Dulcarnon,'&mdash;<i>Billingsley</i>.
This name may have been invented after our author's
time. Query &delta;&omicron;&lambda;&kappa;&alpha;&rho;&eta;&nu;&omicron;&nu;."</p></blockquote>

<p>If we take the words "Dulcarnon" in this
sense, it will help to explain the passage in the
<i>Troilus and Creseide</i>.</p>

<p class="author">E.M.B.</p>


<p><i>Bishop Barnaby</i>.&mdash;The origin of the term
"Bishop Barnaby," as applied to the Lady-bird,
is still unexplained.</p>

<p>I wish to observe, as having some possible connexion
with the subject, that the word "Barnaby"
in the seventeenth century appears to have had a
particular political signification.</p>

<p>For instance, I send you a pamphlet (which
you are welcome to, if you will accept of it) called
"<i>The Head of Nile, or the Turnings and Windings
of the Factious since Sixty, in a dialogue between
Whigg and Barnaby</i>," London, 1681. In this
dialog, Whigg, as might be expected, is the
exponent of all manner of abominable opinions,
whilst Barnaby is represented as the supporter of
orthodoxy.</p>

<p>Again, in the same year was published Durfey's
comedy, "<i>Sir Barnaby Whigg</i>," the union of the
two names indicating that the knight's opinions
were entirely regulated by his interest.</p>

<p class="author">Q.D.</p>

<p>P.S. The pamphlet above alluded to affords
another instance of the use of the word "Factotum,"
at page 41.: "before the Pope had a great
house there, and became Dominus Factotum,
Dominus Deus noster Papu."</p>

<p><i>Barnacles</i>.&mdash;In <i>Speculum Mundi, or a Glass
representing the Face of the World</i>, by John Swan,
M.A., 4th edit., 1670, is the following mention of
the Barnacle goose (pp. 243, 244.):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In the north parts of <i>Scotland</i>, and in the places
adjacent, called <i>Orchades</i>, are certain trees found,
whereon there groweth a certain kind of shell-fish, of a
white colour, but somewhat tending to a russet;
wherein are contained little living creatures. For in
time of maturity the shells do open, and out of them
by little and little grow those living creatures; which
falling into the water when they drop out of their
shells, do become fowls, such as we call <i>Barnacles</i> or
<i>Brant Geese</i>; but the other that fall upon the land,
perish and come to nothing."</p></blockquote>

<p>The author then quotes the passage from Gerard
where mention is made of the Barnacle.</p>

<p class="author">HENRY KERSLEY.</p>

<p><i>Ancient Alms-Dishes</i>.&mdash;I have one of these
dishes; diameter 1 foot 4-3/4 inches, and its height
1-1/2 inch. The centre is plain, without any device,
and separated from the circle of inscription
by a bold embossed pattern.</p>

<p>The inscription is <i>Der infrid gehwart</i>, in raised
(not engraved) capital letters, 1 inch long, repeated
three times in the circle. Mine is a handsome
dish of mixed metal; yielding, when struck,
a fine sound like that of a gong. It has devices
of leaves, &amp;c. engraved on the broad margin, but
no date.</p>

<p>I have seen another such dish, in the collection
of the late William Hooper, Esq., of Ross, part
of which (and I think the whole of the under side)
had been enamelled, as part of the enamel still
adhered to it. In the centre was engraved the
temptation in Eden; but it was without legend or
date.</p>

<p><i>Why the American Aborigines are called Indians</i>.
&mdash;I have often wondered how the aborigines of
America came to be called Indians; and for a
considerable time I presumed it to be a popular
appellation arising from their dark colour. Lately,
however, I fell in with a copy of <i>Theatrum Orbis
Terrarum</i>. Antwerp, 1583, by Abraham Ortelius,
geographer to the king; and, in the map entitled
<i>Typus Orbis Terrarum</i>. I find America called
<i>America, sive India Nova</i>. How it came to get <span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>{255}</span>
the name of <i>India Nova</i> is of course another question,
and one which at present I cannot answer.</p>

a selection from the magnificent collection
of such objects which is preserved at Windsor.</p>

<p>Messrs. Puttick and Simpson, of 191. Piccadilly,
will sell on Thursday next, and five following

French, Spanish, and Italian early Romances,
an extensive series of ancient Italian Books
quoted by the <i>Academia della Crusea,</i> ancient and

<p>We had occasion in a former Number (No. 5.
p. 78) to speak in terms of high and deserved
praise of Mr. Stewart's "Catalogue of Bibles and
Biblical Literature;" the present is no less deserving
of commendation, in as much as it gives
not only the Fathers and Ecclesiastical Writers in
Chronological order, according to Centuries (to
each of which, by the way, Mr. Stewart affixes its
distinctive character, Apostolic, Gnostic, &amp;c., as
given by Cave); but also marking the precise
period in which they severally flourished, so as to
show their succession in each century. So that this
Catalogue, with its Index, and its tempting quotations
from Cranmer and Bishop Hall, which we
regret we have not room to quote, will really be
most useful to all Students of Theology and
Ecclesiastical History.</p>

<p>THE CHORAL RESPONSES AND LITANIES
OF THE UNITED CHURCH OF ENGLAND
AND IRELAND. Collected from Authentic Sources. By the
Rev. JOHN JEBB, A.M., Rector of Peterstow.</p>

<p>The present Work contains a full collection of the harmonized
compositions of ancient date, including nine sets of pieces and
responses and thirteen litanies, with a few of the more ancient
Psalm Chants. They are given in full score, and in their
proper cliffs. In the upper part, however, the treble is substituted
for the "cantus" or "medius" cliff: and the whole work is so
arranged as to suit the library of the musical student, and to be
fit for use in the Choir.</p>

<p>MEMOIRS OF MUSICK. By the Hon.
ROGER NORTH, Attorney General to James I. Now first printed
from the original MS., and edited with copious Notes, by EDWARD
F. RIMBAULT, LL.D., F.S.A., &amp;c. &amp;c. Quarto; with a
Portrait; handsomely printed in 4to.; half-bound in morocco, 15<i>s</i>.</p>

<p>This interesting MS., so frequently alluded to by Dr. Burney
in the course of his "History of Music," has been kindly placed
at the disposal of the Council of the Musical Antiquarian Society,
by George Townshend Smith, Esq., Organist of Hereford Cathedral.
But the Council, not feeling authorised to commence a
series of literary publications, yet impressed with the value of the
work, have suggested its independent publication to their Secretary,
Dr. Rimbault, under whose editorial care it accordingly
appears.</p>

<p>It abounds with interesting Musical Anecdotes; the Greek
Fables respecting the origin of Music; the rise and progress of
Musical Instruments; the early Musical Drama; the origin of our
present fashionable Concerts; the first performance of the Beggar's
Opera, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A limited number having been printed, few copies remain for
sale; unsold copies will shortly be raised in price to 1&pound;. 11<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.</p>

<p>The above COMMITTEE has been formed for the purpose of
organizing an EXHIBITION OF WORKS OF ANCIENT AND
MEDI&AElig;VAL ART. The SOCIETY OF ARTS having considered
that such an Exhibition is not only likely to be interesting to the
public, but also to be especially useful to Manufacturers (with
reference to the Exhibition of Works of Industry of all Nations
to be held in the year 1851), have placed a portion of their Rooms
at the disposal of the Committee, and have agreed to adopt the
Exhibition as part of that annually made by the Society, thereby
taking all the expenses connected with it upon themselves. The
Committee, regarding the Exhibition in the twofold character
contemplated by the Society of Arts, have resolved that the
objects of ancient and medi&aelig;val art of which the Exhibition is to
be composed, shall, as far as possible, be selected with reference
to their beauty and the practical illustration which they are likely
to afford of processes of manufacture; and now beg to invite the
possessors of Works deemed suitable for such an exhibition to
assist the Committee in their very important office, by entering
into communication with them, respecting the nature of any
objects which they may be willing to offer for exhibition.</p>

<p>It is requested that all Works proposed for exhibition be punctually
sent to the Rooms of the SOCIETY OF ARTS, John Street,
Adelphi, on or before the 20th of February, it being imperative
that the Exhibition should open early in March.</p>

<p>Letters and Communications should be addressed to AUGUSTUS

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
